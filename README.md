The data was made publicly available by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) site. Briefly, NHANES are a series of cross-sectional, complex, multi-stage surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on nationally representative, non-institutionalized U.S. population members in order to provide health and nutrition data. For this particular study, the 2013 - 2014 dataset was used, and up to 6000 participants were included in the analysis. The data included five subsets: demographics, dietary, laboratory, examination, and questionnaire. However, for this particular study, examination data were not used due to the amount of missing data. 

The machine learing techniques consists of two parts: regression and binary classification, methods include Gradient Boosting regressor, Support Vector regressor, AdaBoost classifier, and more. 


Course Project – DSC540 Advanced Machine Learning, Chicago, IL	 				 March 2019 – June 2019	

●	Performed feature engineering by preprocessing large datasets from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
●	Elevated feature selection by combining low variance filter, correlation-based method, and univariate mutual information
●	Built Gradient Boosting Regression model with hyperparameter tuning and 5-fold cross-validation to minimize RMSE 
●	Examined Support Vector Machine (SVM) models with normalization scaling and achieved low error using linear kernel 
●	Applied discretization on target feature PHQ-9 for binary classification and improved AdaBoost classifier for high accuracy
